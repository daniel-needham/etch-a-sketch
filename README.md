# etch-a-sketch
I had a lot of fun making this project!

 I decided to make some simple CSS to give it the original Etch-a-Sketch look. This did hamstring me by only really allowing two buttons. Instead of asking the user for a prompt for the sketch resolution, I decided instead to have a button toggle through an array of usable resolutions. 

 The reset button is also fairly hacky - instead of reverting the square divs back to their original class it deletes all children nodes from the parent grid using a while loop and then regenerates all the squares at the selected resolution. 

 I may come back to this to improve the CSS when I get a bit better with it.
